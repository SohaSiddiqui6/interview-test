# Interview Test
A basic test for candidates interested in _Server Side_ development.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

 * **Collections** are containers, **Products** belong to.
 * **Products** have **Collections** associated with them.
 * You need to write _RESTful APIs_ for both **Products** and **Collections**.
 * You need to write an API that updates **Collections** with _Product IDs_
   of the **Products** that are associated with them.
 * There's a theoretical/conceptual question in `/question.txt`,
   you'll need to answer that as well.

 * You can find the data for both **Collections** and **Products** in `/data` folder.
 * The _folder structure_ should be chosen with future development in mind.
    * If you feel there's a certain reason for the _folder structure_ you've
	 chosen to go with, mention it in a seperate file as well.
	 (not important though)
 * Use _Express_ to setup the server.
 * There will be a million ways to do this, so the way you choose to do it
   will be looked at carefully.

 ## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
 * The _approach_ you take to solve the problems.
 * The way you _code_.
 * _Git_ usage.
