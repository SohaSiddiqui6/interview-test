===============================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:

 - Collections are containers, Products belong to.
 - Products have Collections associated with them.
 - You need to write RESTful APIs for both Products and Collections.
 - You need to write an API that updates Collections with Product IDs
   of the Products that are associated with them.
 - There's a theoretical/conceptual question in '/question.txt',
   you'll need to answer that as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - You can find the data for both Collections and Products in '/data' folder.
 - The folder structure should be chosen with future development in mind.
    - If you feel there's a certain reason for the folder structure you've
	 chosen to go with, mention it in a seperate file as well.
	 (not important though)
 - Use Express to setup the server.
 - There will be a million ways to do this, so the way you choose to do it
   will be looked at carefully.

===============================================================================
 WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
 - The approach you take to solve the problems.
 - The way you code.
 - Git usage.
